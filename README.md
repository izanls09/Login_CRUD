Create a small project where you can satisfy the client requisites using HTML, CSS, MySQL and PHP (OOP):

A car selling company wants to have a software where user can login on the browser with the user admin and password 12345 to manage the cars they have in the store.

They want to list their cars showing basic information and be able to create/edit/delete/search cars.

I didn't knew PHP beforehand, this was my first aproach to the language and I liked it more than I thought.
